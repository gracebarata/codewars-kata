// Meet Larry, larry is a bit of a wild one. His mates are always getting him into trouble and telling him to pick a fight with anybody on a night out. Larry doesn't like the odds when his opponent is taller than him, but he will take his chances on an enemy his own height. Here, the outcome of the fight is random. In addition, Larry doesn't want to walk too far to fight, and won't start a fight if it takes longer than 2 minutes to get to his enemy.

// Larry is 170cm and can cover a distance of 2 miles per hour. His opponents' distance is expressed in km.
// Taking all the above in to account, make a function that tells Larry to either "use escape" when an enemy is either too large, or too far away, or to "finish them" when he can win.
